TweetFlick

A class project for an HTML5 class.

Goal: 

To use the Geolocation, Twitter, and Flickr APIs to create a simple Twitter visualizer. 

My project partner wanted to do something with Flickr, and I wanted to do something with Twitter to practice interacting with other servers, so we decided on this as a compromise.

We will use the HTML5 Geolocation API to pull tweets from around the user's location, then analyze the content based on the most common keywords. Text analysis will reveal the most common trends in terms of keywords, which we will then plug into the Flickr API to create a simple image collage visualizing trends in local tweets.
